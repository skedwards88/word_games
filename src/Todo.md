## Crossle

- rename to "spatial" if want to keep crossle for jigsaw?
- add islands or irregular boundary option?

## Jigsaw

- tests
- piece rotation
- hints
- remove new game/bug note
- transpose grid/game solved logic will only work for square grid
- allow to lock/unlock joined pieces?

## Gribbles

## Thirdle

- allow to control whether one or multi space?
- allow to specify number of spaces?
- allow to specify word length?
- allow to specify number of letters given in clue

## Palette

## Packed

- eliminate symmetrical solutions? Or make a setting?

## Other ideas

Interword: Make cross word, but only show letters at intersections. player needs to fill in remaining letters. Any known word that matches intersection letters works. Alternative: instead of showing grid spaces to fill, just show number of letters/blanks in that row like nonagrams.

spatial: arrange words into crossword. maybe have islands or irregular boundary.

solichar (solitaire with letters)

lettris (tetris with letters)

blobbles: palette but with shapes instead

word rush: colored letters, trying to get combos of colors to reach score before time ends

scramble: 5-7 letters in a row or circle, connect subset of letters in any order (no repeats) to form words. See if can find all words in list.

word search: grid of letters + list of words. cross of words from list as find in grid.
