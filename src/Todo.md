# TODO

## General

- get rid of modal styling and instead return different components (like in daily palette)
- upgrade to react 18
- set up precommit hooks to auto run linters and tests
- set up autodeploy and tests
- enums
- multiplayer play or way to share?
- errors/error boundaries
- make styling per file
- put on app stores (one app per game?)
- add test to make sure common exclusion/additions don't share words
- add way to share url with specific game settings
- package code for use in daily palette
- add install button https://web.dev/customize-install/
- 

## Crossle

- tests
- add islands or irregular boundary option?

## Gribbles

## Thirdle

- allow to control whether one or multi space?
- allow to specify number of spaces?
- allow to specify word length?
- allow to specify number of letters given in clue

## Palette

- change color scheme? Or allow as a setting?
- add a way to control difficulty? e.g. min word length, total num letters in clues, color connectedness, word frequency, number of possible solutions

## Packed

- eliminate symmetrical solutions? Or make a setting?

## Other ideas

Interword: Make cross word, but only show letters at intersections. player needs to fill in remaining letters. Any known word that matches intersection letters works. Alternative: instead of showing grid spaces to fill, just show number of letters/blanks in that row like nonagrams.

spatial: arrange words into crossword. maybe have islands or irregular boundary.

solichar (solitaire with letters)

lettris (tetris with letters)

blobbles: palette but with shapes instead

word rush: colored letters, trying to get combos of colors to reach score before time ends

scramble: 5-7 letters in a row or circle, connect subset of letters in any order (no repeats) to form words. See if can find all words in list.

word search: grid of letters + list of words. cross of words from list as find in grid.
