## Other ideas

Interword: Make cross word, but only show letters at intersections. player needs to fill in remaining letters. Any known word that matches intersection letters works. Alternative: instead of showing grid spaces to fill, just show number of letters/blanks in that row like nonagrams.

spatial: arrange words into crossword. maybe have islands or irregular boundary.
