## Other ideas

Interword: Make cross word, but only show letters at intersections. player needs to fill in remaining letters. Any known word that matches intersection letters works. Alternative: instead of showing grid spaces to fill, just show number of letters/blanks in that row like nonagrams.

spatial: arrange words into crossword. maybe have islands or irregular boundary.

solichar (solitaire with letters)

lettris (tetris with letters)

blobbles: palette but with shapes instead

word rush: colored letters, trying to get combos of colors to reach score before time ends

scramble: 5-7 letters in a row or circle, connect subset of letters in any order (no repeats) to form words. See if can find all words in list.

word search: grid of letters + list of words. cross of words from list as find in grid.

have N letters. need to arrange into crossword within grid size
